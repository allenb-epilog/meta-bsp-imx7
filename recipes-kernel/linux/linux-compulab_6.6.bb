# Tell to kernel class that we would like to use our defconfig to configure the kernel.
# Otherwise, the --allnoconfig would be used per default which leads to mis-configured
# kernel.
#
# This behavior happens when a defconfig is provided, the kernel-yocto configuration
# uses the filename as a trigger to use a 'allnoconfig' baseline before merging
# the defconfig into the build.
#
# If the defconfig file was created with make_savedefconfig, not all options are
# specified, and should be restored with their defaults, not set to 'n'.
# To properly expand a defconfig like this, we need to specify: KCONFIG_MODE="--alldefconfig"
# in the kernel recipe include.
KCONFIG_MODE="--alldefconfig"

# We need to pass it as param since kernel might support more then one
# machine, with different entry points
